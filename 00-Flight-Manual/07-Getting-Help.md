# Getting Help

Knowing how to get help is essential. Not just as a bootcamp student, but as a software engineer. Below are a few resources, some specifically for the program.

## Getting Help during a Breakout Session

To get help in class during a breakout session, i.e. class activities, use the `request-ta` channel. Please include the room number if applicable. The first available member of the instructional staff will be there to help the student.

## Getting Help outside of Class

The instructional staff is not available outside of regular class hours: 5:45PM (ET) - 10:00PM (ET) MTTh. To receive help outside of these hours, students should be aware of the following avenues:

### Ask the Class

The slack channel `02-ask-the-class` is provided to the students as a resource to ask fellow classmates for assistance. Oftentimes, simply taking the time to write out the question helps with debugging the issue. This is part of rubber-duck debugging. https://rubberduckdebugging.com/

### Tutoring Sessions

- As part of the student's program fees, a tutor is available to the student at no additional cost. To register for a tutor, please sign into **Canvas**, click on the course currently enrolled, click on **Student Support**, **Student Services**, then in the **Question Category** that displays, click on **tutor request**.
- Note that as a full time student of the program, the student is eligible for **2 tutor sessions** per week. The student must make every attempt to make it to the session is an appointment is made or the student must give a notice to the tutor if it is not possible to make it in 24 hours. If proper notice is not made, the student may lose his/her/their eligibility to request for tutors.

### AskBCS Learning Assistants in Slack

AskBCS Learning Assistant is an application within Slack. The student can use AskBCS Learning Assistants to submit curriculum-based questions to a live person during normal operating hours.

### Xpert Learning Assistance

On Canvas, there will be an tab called the `Xpert Learning Assistant`, which is Chat feature that is built on top of ChatGPT. It was trained with student questions that were common throughout the years.

Thus, you can use it to ask questions throughout the bootcamp on a myriad of different concepts. **We highly encourage using this in-house platform rather than the generic ChatGPT.** The answers will be much more catered to your current bootcamp experiences and will be a safe in-house environment to begin to understand these powerful tools.

## If you want to expedite the help you need:

1. _Read AND Google the error message first._ Most error messages have already been solved on the internet. Search for it!
2. _Include your code._ A snippet of the code or a link to the GitHub repo is helpful.
3. _Be specific._ Saying, "I have an error" isn't helpful. Copy/pasting the exact error text and/or providing a screenshot _is_.
4. _Include a screenshot._ Sometimes, seeing the issue in context helps us solve the problem.
5. _Include a screencast._ If the bug is an issue that only occurs when you interact with a page, it may be helpful to record a video of that interaction.
