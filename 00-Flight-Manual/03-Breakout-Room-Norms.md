# Breakout Room Norms

## Structure and Grouping

Breakout rooms will be organized in several different ways, depending on the activity:

- In the beginning first half of class, randomly assigned groups of 2, 3, or 4.
- In the second half of class (after break), solo, group, and aid rooms will be opened. Students may hop into a room of their choosing.
- This system may be changed as the class goes on to fit the class culture & environment, but it will begin this way to help students familiarize themselves with their peers. 
- When using the aid rooms, a student will use the **request-ta** channel to ask for assistance. The student will mention the room # that they are in and an instructional staff will mark a green checkmark on the message and go to help them.
- The **request-ta** channel can be used across both sessions. It is used as a queue system so that both the students as well as the instructional staff are aware of the order of students. Please be patient as the instructional staff may not get to the students immediately.

## Expectations

1. First, select one student to share his/her/their screen. This student will be the “coder” for this activity.
2. Second, make sure all students in the group understands the activity’s instructions.
3. Other group members will “Pair Program” by giving verbal guidance to the “coder”.
4. The “coder” will not necessarily drive the activity. Instead he/she/they will rely on guidance from the others in the group to complete the task. The “coder” can initiate writing code independently after verbally explaining their intentions to the rest of the group.
5. If additional help is required, please request assistance via the **#request-ta** channel in slack.
6. **Note**: Before asking for help, we highly encourage the students attempt it themselves first! At the minimum, please read the instructions for the exercise in the README.
