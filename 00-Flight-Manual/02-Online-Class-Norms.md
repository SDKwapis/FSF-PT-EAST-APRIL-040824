# Online Class Norms

## Workspace Environment

- Find the most quiet, distraction-free area in your home to begin class.
- A second monitor is required.

## Attendance and Timeliness

- The zoom link will become active at the start of optional office hours.
- Class instruction will begin on time or within a minute or two of the scheduled start time.
- Students who arrive more than 45 minutes after the start of class, or leave more than 45 minutes before the end of class will be marked absent.
- Students who have their cameras off for significant periods of time without just reason will be marked absent.
- The instructional staff will be marking attendance based on students' presence with camera on. If the camera is off for a significant period of time, the instructional staff have the right to mark you absent. The students have the right to appeal the absences via messaging an instructional staff member directly.
- If the student is late or absent, video recordings of class will be posted in Canvas the day after class for the student's review.

## Zoom and Screenshare

- Everyone’s video will **always** be on during class! If a valid reason can be given to the instructional staff for the camera to be off, it may be waived. However, we **highly** encourage camera on. _(Video can be turned off during breaks/dinner)_
- Students can use Zoom’s “Virtual Background” feature to mask visual background distractions.
- Students could be asked to share screen during in-class activities.
- If a student needs an exception to the above policy, please contact the instructor directly via Slack.

## Questions and Classroom Interaction

- All questions are important and valid, but not all questions are attached to that day's objectives.
- If a student has a question related to the lecture, please use the raise hand via Zoom participants tab.
- When called upon, students can unmute mic and ask.
- Students can also use Slack **#parking-lot** to ask questions not directly related to the topic at hand.
- If the instructor feels the question is not best addressed right then, he/she/they may ask the student to direct it to the **#parking-lot** channel for later attention.
- Outside of class and after hours, students should utilize the **#02-ask-the-class** channel to receive assistance from fellow classmates.

## Office Hours

- Office hours are optional and available for students to get personalized assistance from the instructional staff. Take advantage of this.
- TAs will be available to help with homework or cover any material which is confusing to students.
- Additionally, scheduled activities in the main room may include:
  - Review sessions
  - Extra-curricular sessions
  - AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions

## Feedback

- This course utilizes several feedback methods. They include, but are not limited to:
  - "Fist-to-Five" polls

## Challenges

- The challenge is graded by the Centralized Grading Team. It is the student's responsibility to watch BCS for any Ungraded or Incomplete assignments. Assignments that cannot be graded count against the student's graduation requirements.
- A challenge will be provided every week pending project weeks or any schedule changes due to emergencies or holidays. The instructional staff will work to keep the due dates consistent.
- In the event that the students' challenge is ungraded, students may request a challenge regrade. To request a regrade, update all appropriate links in BCS and submit a Request for Regrade on Canvas.
