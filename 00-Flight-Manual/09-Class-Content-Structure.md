# Class Content Structure

The following is a brief walkthrough of the way that the class will be structured:

### A Normal Class Day

1. A normal class day will officially begin at 6:30PM EST. If on a new Unit, students will first be presented with a slideshow to introduce concepts about the unit while in other days, lectures will continue with the content from the previous day. At the beginning of each unit, the instructor will INTRODUCE the challenge to both illustrate what the final target of that unit is as well as allow students to begin the challenges early if they wish.
 (**Note**: based on class preference, this can also change to the END of the unit)

2. A unit will constitute three primary folders that can be accessed by pulling down content from the class's **GitLab** repository. The **Activities** folder, the **Challenges** folder, and if applicable, the **Algorithm** folder.

   - The **Activities** folder will contain the activities that will be covered throughout the normal lecture day. In a normal class day, the **Ins** marked folders (oftentimes an odd-number folder) will be used as a way for the instructor to introduce the topic. After introducing the topic, students will be sent into separate breakout rooms to attempt the folders marked **Stu** (oftentimes an even-numbered folder) for 15 to 20 minutes. Instructions for these activities are in the _README.md_ file for each of these individual folders. Students are highly encouraged to collaborate together to tackle these activities.

   - The **Mini Project** folders (also in the **Activities folder**) may or may noy be covered during the lecture portion of class. They are provided to give students additional practice outside of class if they are looking for additional practice. The **Main** folder contains the SOLUTION for that mini project and are VERY useful to figure out the challenge of the unit. These **Main** folders will always be available when the content is pulled down.

   - The **02-Challenges** folder contains the HOMEWORK of that given unit. The _README.md_ file contains the instructions for the assignment as well as the breakdown of the grading rubric. On even-numbered weeks, a **Starter** folder will also be part of the **02-Challenges** folder. The **Starter** folder contains STARTER code designed to help students begin the challenges.

   - There is no guarantee that starter code will always be provided. _It is highly encouraged that students attempt the challenge as soon as possible._ While students will not be introduced to all the tools necessary to solve the challenge, they can begin to solve small portions of the challenge itself to make the content much more digestible. At the minimum, read through the instructions of the challenge in the _README.md_ the day you gain access to the new unit.

   The **Algorithms** folder is for the students to get extra practice with questions that have been popular in multiple interview settings. It is recommended to give these a shot on your own time and check to see if the solutions are correct by comparing them to others online.Note, there are multiple ways to solve a problem! So use this folder as additional practice if the class content is not enough. 

### Project Day

- There will be 3 Group Collaboration projects. Students will be assigned to random groups and they are given the flexibility to build anything they wish pending approval from the instructional staff. If approved, students may build their projects as long as they meet the TECHNICAL requirements that will be outlined during project week.
- The first day of project week is often used to give students to produce their ideas and receive approvals from the instructional staff. Requirements for project approval will be given during project week.
- Students are then given the rest of the class time for the 2 weeks to work on their projects.
- The last day of project weeks will be presentation day. Students are given 10~15 minutes to present their work in a **professional manner**, akin to how presentations are expected from software engineers. This will be covered much more in-depth during project week.
- Students are given the opportunity to form their **own groups** for project 3. More information will be provided in the future.
