# ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, and AI

The following is in regards to external toolings that have become popular recently (ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, and general AI tools)

### ChatGPT

1. With the rise in prominence in ChatGPT for general enjoyment and help with daily work, students have begun to utilize ChatGPT to help them through this class' challenges and assignments. While it can be difficult to discern if it was individual work or if it was using ChatGPT, **over-reliance on this tool is going to hurt your education moreso than aid you!** While this tool and other AI tools will greatly enhance your ability to code in the future, if you use them to solve your challenges with no inherent understanding of your own, it will become a crutch. I recommend not using it during the course unless you are looking to answer more **conceptual questions**. 

### Co-Pilot

1. Github created an extension that you can pay monthly to find common code-snippets to reduce the time it takes to code for more seasoned developers. As this is a class designed for students who have had little or no coding experience, **using this tool to help with your coding or working on challenges will hurt your education!** So please refraine from using this tool during the class.

### AI in general!

1. I understand the excitement and desire to use AI to help with your coding (this is my current studies after all!), but please refrain from using it during the class unless it is a topic of interest that you want to supplement your code, not replace it. There are things you will have to learn first before you learn to rely or use AI (beyond just coding skills) that you will learn in this class. So I ask that you avoid using this tooling until you have these fundamental skills.
